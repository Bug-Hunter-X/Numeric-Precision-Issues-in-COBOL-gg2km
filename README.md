This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs related to handling numeric precision. The `bug.cob` file shows a program that truncates decimal values unexpectedly, leading to incorrect comparisons and potentially flawed logic. The solution provided in `bugSolution.cob` shows how to explicitly define the precision of numeric fields and handle potential truncation to prevent these errors.
